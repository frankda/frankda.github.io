## Importance of building a blog

I first have the thought of building a blog when began learning python and html. During this process, I found it is convenient to take notes for the important points. Also, notes can help me to organize my thoughts and make me thinking more logically. While logic is a basic character for programmer.

I will record what I learned and difficulties I met in learning program. Start from build my first github page by using jekyll.
